When you are acting as the lead strategist, data analyst, and execution partner, manually adjusting bids on 10,000 keywords across 500 campaigns is not an option. It is a failure of system design.

To scale an Amazon PPC operation as a lean team, you have to replace manual intuition with algorithmic rules.

## Defining the Logic

Before you can automate, you must define the logic. We structure our bid management workflows into three distinct operational states:

1. **Harvesting Data:** For keywords with low impressions. Increase bids incrementally until we find the market clearing price.
2. **Profit Optimization:** For keywords with high spend but no sales, or an ACoS above the target threshold. Decrease bids aggressively.
3. **Scale & Protect:** For keywords hitting our target ROAS. Defend the position by adjusting bids slightly to maintain Top of Search placement.

## Building the Rule Engine

Whether you use Amazon's native rules, a third-party software layer, or a custom Python script interfacing with the Amazon Ads API, the logic remains the same.

> "Automation does not replace strategy; it enforces it at scale."

### Example Workflow: The Bleeder Rule

If a keyword has spent $20 (or 1.5x the average order value) with 0 sales over a 7-day lookback window, drop the bid by 20%.

### Example Workflow: The Winner Rule

If a keyword has generated more than 3 orders with an ACoS under 20% over a 14-day lookback window, increase the bid by 10% and apply a Top of Search modifier.

## The Result

By automating the micro-decisions (bid adjustments), you free up your mental bandwidth to focus on the macro-decisions (launching new products, creative optimization, and market positioning). Ship the rules, monitor the anomalies, and let the system do the heavy lifting.
