I see it every day: an Amazon seller pauses a highly relevant PPC campaign because the ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales) hit 45%, while their target profit margin is only 30%. On paper, that campaign is losing money.

In reality, pausing it just tanked their organic ranking and killed their overall business profitability.

## The Organic Flywheel

Amazon's A9 algorithm rewards sales velocity. It does not care whether a sale was generated organically or via an ad click. When you buy a sale through PPC, you are also buying **organic rank**.

If you aggressively cut PPC spend to lower your ACoS, your sales velocity drops. When your velocity drops, you lose organic page rank. When you lose organic rank, your organic sales dry up, leaving you entirely dependent on ads.

## Enter TACoS (Total Advertising Cost of Sales)

TACoS measures your ad spend against your **Total Revenue** (Organic + PPC).

**The Formula:**
`TACoS = (Total Ad Spend / Total Sales) * 100`

### Analyzing the Workflows

Tracking TACoS tells you how dependent your brand is on advertising.

- **TACoS is flat, Sales are rising:** The holy grail. Your PPC is driving organic growth. The flywheel is spinning.
- **TACoS is rising, Sales are flat:** Warning sign. Your organic sales are dropping, and you are spending more on ads just to maintain your current revenue.
- **TACoS is dropping, Sales are dropping:** You over-optimized your PPC. You cut too much ad spend, and it choked your organic visibility.

## Ship-it Strategy: Blended Margin

Stop managing your business at the campaign level. Build a workflow that tracks blended margin. As a manager, your goal isn't to make Amazon's ad console look pretty; your goal is to maximize the net profit deposited into the bank account every two weeks.

Optimize for the business, not the dashboard.
